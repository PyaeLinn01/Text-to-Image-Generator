## Overview

This project aims to convert descriptive text prompts into visually accurate images, serving a wide range of applications, from creative artwork generation to realistic visualizations based on user descriptions. The system uses a deep learning model trained on text-image pairs to understand and visualize text concepts effectively.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Conversion**: Generates images from user-provided textual descriptions.
- **Customizable Output**: Ability to adjust image parameters for more control over output styles.
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized for faster generation with high-quality results.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface for text input and image viewing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**: Frameworks for deep learning model training and deployment.
- **Stable Diffusion** or **DALL-E** (optional): Model backbones for text-to-image generation.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web interface (if applicable).
- **CUDA**: For GPU acceleration (if applicable).

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PyaeLinn01/Text-to-Image-Generator.git
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:

   Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the model**:

   - Download any necessary pre-trained models if specified in the project (e.g., `stable-diffusion-v1`).
   - Place the model files in the designated directory within the project.

4. **Run the application**:

   For a Streamlit interface (if provided), start the application by running:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

Enter a descriptive text prompt into the input field to generate an image based on the text. Adjust parameters as desired for different visual effects, and click "Generate" to see the output.
